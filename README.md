Back up all of your rco files before doing this (make sure you don't change the name of the files)
make sure your ps3 is connected to Wifi and you know your ps3's IP
download and install FilleZilla Client (on your pc/laptop) if you don't have it already
if something goes wrong you can use FilleZilla to connect to your ps3 and
in the Remote site you can type in: /dev_blind and go to /dev_blind/vsh/resource
and copy the back up rco files onto the ps3
and then restart the ps3 and it should be fixed, i would also recommend reinstalling your CFW

if you want to do this go for it but i take responsibillty for any Damage or Breakage this might do to your ps3!

all icons/rcos have been tested by me, on my Evilnat CFW (4.92.2, DEX)
Proceed With Caution if your ps3's system firmware is newer or older than mine, these rcos have only been tested on Evilnat Custom Firmware it may break your console if your on different Custom Firmware like Rebug or if your on PS3Hen and not CFW


Follow the path and put thoso files into your Zeyfox store to add these
